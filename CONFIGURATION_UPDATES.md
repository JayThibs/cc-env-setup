# Configuration Updates Summary

## Changes Made to install.sh

### 1. Updated .wezterm.lua Configuration
- **Added complete color scheme configuration** matching Tokyo Night theme with detailed color definitions
- **Updated keybindings** to use `Ctrl+A/E` for line navigation instead of `Home/End`
- **Added extensive keybindings** for:
  - Pane splitting (`Cmd+D`, `Cmd+Shift+D`)
  - Pane navigation (`Cmd+Alt+H/J/K/L`)
  - Pane resizing (`Cmd+Shift+Alt+H/J/K/L`)
  - Pane closing (`Cmd+W`)
  - Fullscreen toggle (`Cmd+Shift+Enter`)
  - Copy/Paste (`Cmd+C/V`)
  - Clear scrollback (`Cmd+K`)
  - Search (`Cmd+F`)
- **Added mouse bindings** for right-click paste and Ctrl+scroll font size adjustment
- **Added visual bell configuration** and cursor blink rate
- **Added initial window size** (120x40)

### 2. Updated .zshrc Configuration
- **Updated rl function** to match current implementation:
  - Now requires a file argument
  - Shows usage if no argument provided
  - Returns error code 1 on missing argument
- **Simplified chpwd function** to just call `ls` instead of `eza --icons`
- **Added missing zstyle for process colors** in completion
- **Removed vi mode keybindings** for history search
- **Added cc4 alias** for launching 4 Claude Code instances
- **Updated comments** for keybindings to be more descriptive

### 3. What Was NOT Changed
The installer does not include:
- npm global bin path configuration
- Conda initialization
- NVM initialization
- Bun completions and path
- The `.local/bin/env` sourcing

These are environment-specific configurations that users would need to add manually based on their setup.

## Verification Steps

To verify the installer creates the correct configurations:

1. **For .wezterm.lua**: Check that all keybindings work correctly, especially:
   - Natural text editing (Cmd+arrows, Option+arrows)
   - Pane management
   - The Tokyo Night color scheme displays properly

2. **For .zshrc**: Verify:
   - The rl function works with a single file argument
   - Auto-suggestions work with right arrow
   - History search works with up/down arrows
   - The cc4 alias launches the multi-instance script

## Additional Notes

The current configuration files contain user-specific paths and tools (conda, nvm, bun) that should not be included in a general installer. Users will need to add these manually after running the installer if they use these tools.
